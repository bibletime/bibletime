      Created a new package bibletime-i18n-de for German docs, with the folders docs/ and po/.
      Revised gen_am.sh file to suit the new arrangement, and it does at least run and create all the
      necessary Makefile.am files for English and German.

2002-05-03  Martin <mg.pub@gmx.net>

    * Ported to KDE3: BibleTime 1.2. No new features. Text rendering works much better now
        (right-to-left), as well as font / charset handling -- thanks to Trolltech.

2002-10-04 Martin Gruner
    * Differences between 1.0 and 1.1:
        - Improved interface:
            o Better optionsdialog: Better structure, more powerful settings
            o Better menu structure: The documentation is now accessible from the Help menu, ...
            o Keyaccelerators for each display window type
            o much more
        - General Book Support (GBS): Books like "Josephus" are supported now.
            Operations like bookmarking, printing, copying or saving work just like with
            Bibles, commentaries or lexicons.
        - Crossreference support
            Crossreferences work now. For example you can click now on a strong number to open the
            module for it which displayes the chosen number. The same for Bibles, morph tags etc.
            Tooltips work for the links, too.
        - Improved Unicode support
            Unicode encoded modules are now supported in a better way. Choosing the font and
            the displaying of the text works better. RTL support and better rendering is still
            missing.
        - Profile management. Profiles capture the current state of the working area
            (opened display windows, scrollbar positions, set keys ...). Profiles can be loaded to
            restore the old state and can be saved to store the current state for later. Automatically
            restoring the windows after startup is possible, too.
        - Better crash management. BibleTime tries now to save settings if a crash occured. Although we
            implemented this, we don't know how to make BibleTime crash ;) It's just for your safety.
        - Speed improvements. Printing is almost two times faster now. Searching in modules is also faster,
            but this was improved in the Sword library by the Sword developers.
        - Improved display windows. Independent display settings for each window (footnotes, strongs ...)
        - Fullscreen mode of the main application window
        - Improved commentary editor: Ask if the text should be saved if the window or BibleTime should be closed
            if the changed text was not saved before.

2001-11-24 Fred Saalbach <saalbach@sybercom.net>
    * Moved documentation to bibletime-docs - includes .po files, handbook, etc.
    * This will reduce the size of the main program and allow more flexibility
