/**
  This is a special menu, which shows the contents of an item model. The menu is repopulated
  with data from the item model each time before its shown, and it does not in any other way
  react to changes in the model.

  The menu is built from items in the model which are below the given parent index. By
  default this parent index is invalid. When the menu is about to show, all items directly
  below the parent index are inserted. If a child item has children of its own it is inserted
  as a QMenu which will be built recursively. Otherwise the child item is inserted as a
  QAction which may be triggered by the user.

  When subclassing this menu, reimplement preBuildMenu() and postBuildMenu() to add new menu
  items before or after the menu is populated with data from the associated item model. You
  can also reimplement newAction() and newMenu() if you further want to tune the appearance
  or behaviour of this menu.

  \warning This menu might not properly handle changes in the source model while being shown,
           so beware to check whether the index emitted by triggered() is valid.
