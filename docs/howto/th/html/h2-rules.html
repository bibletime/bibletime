We
want to expand that now by delving briefly into biblical hermeneutics, whose
goal is to discover the meaning intended by the original author (and
Author!). While many applications of a passage are valid, only one
interpretation is valid. The scripture itself says this by saying that no
scripture is of any private interpretation (2 Pe.1:20 KJV <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Knowing
this first, that no prophesy of scripture is of any private
interpretation.</span>”</span>). Certain rules are helps toward discovering the
correct meaning; by ignoring these rules people have brought much trouble on
themselves and their followers. 2 Pe.3:16 <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">...in which are some things
hard to understand, which the untaught and unstable distort, as they do also
the rest of the Scriptures, to their own destruction.</span>”</span></p><p>How do we go about discovering the intended meaning of a passage? Let's say
your attention has been drawn to a particular verse whose meaning is not
clear to you. How do you study it out? Keep these rules in mind:</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="h2-rules-exact"></a>Rule 1 - Interpret according to the exact meaning of the words.</h2></div></div></div><p>The more precise we can be with the exact, original meaning of the words the
better our interpretation will be. Try to find the exact meaning of the key
words by following these steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p><b>นิยาม. </b>Look up the definition in a Greek or Hebrew dictionary.  For verbs, the verb
tense is also crucial.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><b>Cross-reference. </b>Compare scripture with scripture. Seeing how the same Greek or Hebrew word
(not the English word) is used in scripture may clarify or throw new light
on the definition.  How does the same author use this word elsewhere? Other
authors? Your reference tools may give you uses of the word in non-biblical
documents, as well. Why do we have to go to the original languages; why
isn't the English word good enough? <span class="emphasis"><em>Because more than one Greek
word may be translated into the same English word, and the Greek words may
have different shades of meaning.</em></span></p></li></ol></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="h2-rules-exact-crossref-ex1a"></a>ตัวอย่าง 1A</h3></div></div></div><p>Jn.20:17 <span class="emphasis"><em>"Touch me not"</em></span> (KJV) sounds harsh, doesn't it?
Sounds like Jesus doesn't want to be touched now that He is risen, that He
is too holy or something. But that doesn't seem right, so let's look it up
in Spiros Zodhiates' <span class="emphasis"><em>The Complete Word Study New
Testament</em></span> (AMG Publishers, 1991).</p><p>Definition: Turning to John 20:17, above the word "Touch" we see "pim680."
The letters give us a code for the part of speech, and the number refers to
Strong's dictionary reference.  Let's look up the definition
(p. 879). "680. Haptomai; from hapto (681), touch. Refers to such handling
of an object as to exert a modifying influence upon it... Distinguished from
pselaphao (5584), which actually only means to touch the surface of
something. " Now look up "pim." The grammar codes in Zodhiates come right
after Revelation; on p. 849 we see that pim stands for "present imperative
active (80)". On p.857, "Present Imperative.  In the active voice, it may
indicate a command to do something in the future which involves continuous
or repeated action or, when it is negated, a command to stop doing
something. " This is a negative command, so it is to stop doing something
that is already occurring. So, what have we found?</p><p>
        <span class="emphasis"><em>Mary is already clinging to Jesus, and he is saying to stop
holding him!</em></span>

sick</em></span>. What is this anointing?</p><p>Definition of aleipho (218) - "to oil" (Strong's); but we also have another
Greek word translated "anoint", chrio (5548) - "to smear or rub with oil,
i.e. to consecrate to an office or religious service" (Strong's). Since it's
a verb, consider the tense also, "apta" aorist participle active. "The
aorist participle expresses simple action, as opposed to continuous
action...When its relationship to the main verb is temporal, it usually
signifies action prior to that of the main verb." (Zodhiates p.851)</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>Cross-references for aleipho: </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>Mt.6:17 But you, when you fast, anoint your head</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Mk.16:1 [the women] brought spices that they might come and anoint Him.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Mk.6:13 And they were...anointing with oil many sick people and healing
them.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Lk.7:38 [...] kissing His feet and anointing them with the perfume</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Jn.12:3 Mary [...] anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped them with her hair</p></li></ol></div></li><li class="listitem"><p>Cross-references of chrio: </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>Lk.4:18 <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because He has anointed me
to preach [...]</span>”</span></p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Acts 4:27 Jesus, whom Thou hast anointed</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Acts 10:38 God anointed Jesus with the Holy Ghost and power</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>2 Cor.1:21 Now He who...anointed us is God</p></li></ol></div></li></ul></div><p>So what's the difference between aleipho and chrio? Look back over the
cross-references and the definitions, and sum up the difference:
<span class="emphasis"><em>"aleipho" is a practical use of oil and "chrio" is a
spiritual</em></span></p><p>As an illustration (although the word is not used) of the practical use of
oil at that time, when the good Samaritan cared for the man beat up by
robbers he poured oil and wine in the wound. So oil had a medicinal use in
Jesus' day.</p><p>Now let's apply what we just learned by this word study to James 5:14
<span class="emphasis"><em>"Is any among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the church;
and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the
Lord."</em></span>Is "anointing" spiritual or practical? Practical!</p><p>And the tense in Greek, the aorist participle, would be better translated
"having anointed," so the order is the anointing first, then the prayer ("in
the name of the Lord"refers to the prayer, not the anointing). James 5 is
saying that the elders should give the sick person medicine and pray for him
in the name of the Lord. Doesn't that express a beautiful balance of
practical and spiritual in our God!</p></div></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="h2-basics-worksheet.html">ก่อนหน้า</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"> </td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="h2-rules-context.html">ต่อไป</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Worksheet: How to Use a Concordance </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">หน้าแรก</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Rule 2 - Interpret within the biblical context</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
