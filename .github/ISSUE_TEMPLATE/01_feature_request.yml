      :information_source: Thank you for suggesting new features! However, please note that BibleTime's development is currently limited by our small team size, which makes it challenging to implement major new features in the near future.

      We appreciate all feature suggestions and will consider them for future planning when resources allow. In the meantime, we encourage users to contribute code to help make desired features a reality.

      Thank you for your understanding!
