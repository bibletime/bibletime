"References to body parts of God are used by Latter-Day Saints to prove that "
"God was once a man just as we are. Once they convince people of that, they "
"go on to teach that we can become God just like He is! At a lecture he was "
"giving, a group of Mormon elders challenged Walter Martin (author of "
"<emphasis>Kingdom of the Cults</emphasis>) with an enumeration of verses "
"like these. Dr. Martin then asked the Mormons to read one more scripture: "
"Ps.91:4 <quote>He will cover you with His feathers; And under His wings "
"shalt thou trust</quote>. W.M. said, <quote>By the same rules of "
"interpretation that you just proved God to be a man, you just proved that He "
"is a bird</quote>. The Mormons had to laugh as they realised the "
"ridiculousness of their position."
